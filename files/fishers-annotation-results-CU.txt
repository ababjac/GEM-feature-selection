Two-sided Fisher's Exact Test Results -

This test answer's the question: Among the significant features, does biosynthesis occur at a different frequency than non-biosynthesis features in cultured organisms?

The test for the actual pathway counts is not signficant. This means that the proportion of significant cultured biosynthesis is not different than the proportion of significant uncultured biosynthesis. There is a difference in the counts of the shuffled and real counts which suggests that the there is signal in the features selected by LASSO.

Contingency table of the form:
             is-biosynthesis-sig not-biosynthesis-sig
cultured    [[        x1                  y1        ]
uncultured   [        x2                  y2        ]]
