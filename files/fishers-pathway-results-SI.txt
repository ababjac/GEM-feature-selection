Two-sided Fisher's Exact Test Results -

This test answer's the question: Do we see biosynthesis features as significant to LASSO more than we see non-biosynthesis features?

Since neither test is significant, we conclude the proportion of biosynthesis selected to be significant is not statistically different than the proportion of non-biosynthesis features.

Contingency table of the form:
             is-biosynthesis not-biosynthesis
significant    [[  x1               y1]
not significant [  x2               y2]]
