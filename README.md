# GEM-feature-selection

Main Idea:
- It would be a major scientific finding to identify features of microbial genomes that are associated with that genome belonging to an uncultured organism
- However, there is major phylogenetic bias in the organisms that are uncultured. All 200+ microbial phyla contain uncultured species, but most phyla do not contain cultured species.
- Metabolism is strongly correlated to taxonomy, so therefore there’s a strong correlation between whether a species has been cultured and what its genome contains that probably isn’t related to whether it has been cultured
- So: is there a way to control for phylogeny, when selecting features that distinguish between cultured and uncultured microbes?
